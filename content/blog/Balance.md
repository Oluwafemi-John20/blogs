As humans one of the most important things we can build is oneself. Building our career, body, spiritual stamina, financial stablity among others. While there is a lot of positive sides to striving for growth and being laser focused on improving particular aspects of our lives. A situation that made this thought so vivid was an interesting time out with friends few months ago. When we went bowling and I had started the game very well for the first time and I knock down all the pins in two attempts but I was so fixated on getting a strike because, why not? Next few rounds came and I increased the speed of the ball which was the right thing to do but to my astonishment I ended with worse scores than when I had started the game. 

This incident made me realize that as much as we want to grow and improve the next thing, we have to grow being concious of the things we are currently doing and not just focusing on the things we want to achieve. Balance is the key to success. It is about maintaining a healthy balance between our desires, our aspirations and our current circumstances. 

As failure is a part of growth and we need to ensure that the reason for failing is not due to the neglegence of the past and basic things to focus on a more advanced method or skill. As a student working remotely, I was able to balance a lot of activites such as conducting my final year research and writing my dissertation, attending classes, leading a community, building high performance dashboards, building data pipelines among other. During these maintaining balance was difficult, but it was also very rewarding; 

How do I maintain balance is the million dollar question. I'll keep it simple as possible. Here are some strategies that I've found helpful:

1. Don't lose sight of the goal: Always remember what you want to achieve is to become better . As the stated incidents, you don't get so fixated on getting a strike that you lose sight of knocking down the pin and scoring points. It is good to get better but this shouldn't stop you from hitting the objectives even with the basic skill.

2. Leverage your leisure for productivity: Earlier this year, I read a book "The Magic of Thinking Big" by "DAVID J. SCHWARTZ, PH.D." clearly explained how the distinction in performance of two sales representatives was attributed to their leisure activities. An overwhelmed mind finds it difficult to solve problems or do so in longer time. The way we decide to use our leisure can affect productivity and how we are able to balance activities. Try to get activities that refreshes your mind and makes you feel relaxed.

Balance is very important to become a successful person and it is a skill that is tested at different stages of life be it marriage, career, friendships etc. You can't live life in isolation which makes balance very important for a happy and successful life.
These are approaches that I have found to help me maintain balance across different spheres of life. As I continue to discover things and understand best practices either from experience or literature, I will write about them.
