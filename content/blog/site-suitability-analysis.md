# Introduction

Access to essential health services, including pharmacies and hospitals, is a critical aspect of urban planning and public health. In rapidly developing urban areas, such as Gwarinpa in Abuja, the distribution of health-related infrastructure can significantly influence the well-being of residents. Identifying suitable locations for new health facilities and pharmacies ensures that communities have equitable access to healthcare services while optimizing urban space.

This project aims to assess the suitability of different areas within Gwarinpa for potential health service expansion. Using geospatial analysis techniques, factors such as building footprint density, proximity to road networks, proximity to existing pharmacies, and distance to health facilities were evaluated. By applying a weighted overlay approach, the study produces a site suitability map that highlights the most appropriate locations for new health services, supporting informed decision-making for urban planners and policymakers.

# Methodology

The assessment was carried out by assigning weights to different factors that influence the suitability of areas within **Gwarinpa Area, Abuja**.

The factors considered include:

| Factors | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| Building footprint density | A higher building footprint density implies suitability. |
| Proximity to road networks | A closer distance to the road provides better accessibility. |
| Proximity to existing pharmacies | A lower pharmacy density is more suitable. |
| Distance to health facilities (hospitals) | Close proximity to health facilities is more suitable. |

A **weighted overlay** of the above parameters produced the resulting site suitability map. The weight for each parameter is displayed in the table below.

| S/N | Parameter | Weights |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| 1   | Building footprint density | 30% |
| 2   | Proximity to road networks | 30% |
| 3   | Proximity to existing pharmacies | 25% |
| 4   | Distance to health facilities | 15% |
|     | **Total** | **100%** |

# Conclusion

This study assessed the suitability of areas within Gwarinpa, Abuja, for potential expansion of health services using geospatial analysis. By considering factors such as building footprint density, proximity to road networks, proximity to existing pharmacies, and distance to health facilities, a weighted overlay approach was applied to produce a site suitability map.

The results highlight areas that are most suitable for new health service infrastructure, providing a clear visual guide for urban planners and policymakers. This approach ensures that future health facilities are strategically located to maximize accessibility and minimize redundancy, thereby improving service delivery and contributing to the overall well-being of the community.  

The methodology demonstrated in this study can be adapted and applied to other urban areas, enabling data-driven planning and decision-making for health infrastructure development across different contexts.
